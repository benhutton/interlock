# These are the steps I took to get to run the basic unit tests.
#   is there any 'official' way to do this?

mkdir test/integration/app/log
RAILS_ENV=test ; export RAILS_ENV # Hmmm... or not -- the environments/test.rb isn't setup correctly - it wants to run as development
-- edit test/integration/app/config/database.yml # because I don't run root/<blank>
-- grant myself permissions to great new tables (/opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysql -u root -p) # again cause I don't run as root
sudo gem install multi_rails

ruby test/setup.rb
ruby test/unit/finder_test.rb # etc
