Steps to run the tests.

  $ mkdir test/integration/app/log
  $ RAILS_ENV=development; export RAILS_ENV 
  
If you don't run mysql as root, edit the user in test/integration/app/config/database.yml, 
and grant him permissions to create new tables (/opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysql -u root -p).

  $ sudo gem install multi_rails echoe
  $ rake

To run an individual suite, first run:

  $ ruby test/setup.rb
  
Then:

  $ ruby test/unit/finder_test.rb
  
etc.
